This is an example of a lightweight J2EE web application based on PicoContainer and post-redirect-get user interaction. I've deliberately decided not to use the excellent Spring Framework container and libraries so I can use this application as a training tool for teaching dependency injection, simple templating and post-redirect-get in a much more constrained context. Otherwise the first thing I have to do is to teach people about Spring and that's often not why I am there.
